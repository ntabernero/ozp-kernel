OzonePlatform Distribution 
======================

This is the distribution of the Ozone Platform.  This distribution is packaged 
inside a standalone version of Apache Tomcat.

This is the first alpha release of OWF 8 and is pretty much non-functional.  The release's main
goal was to build out the build and test infrastructure to be able to produce a release at all.  


Setup
-----
1. Unzip package

Running
--------
1. Run start.bat in the apache-tomcat-7.0.32 directory.
2. To view Karaf OSGI console, go to http://localhost:8181/system/console (currently reveals three skeleton OWF features)
3. To view website, go to http://localhost:8181/owf (currently just a static message)
